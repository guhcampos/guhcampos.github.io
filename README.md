# guhcampos.github.io

This is the sorce repository of my personal webpage, hosted on
https://guhcampos.github.io. As you see I decided to open source the whole
thing just to make the whole process public as I plan to add interesting stuff
here, such as fetching content remotely from multiple platforms I use on my
personal life. In the end, it doubles as an experimental platform for me to play
with a bunch of adjacent technologies, from some frontend stuff I'm not too
familiar with to the new AI tooling around.
