I'm a shuffle type of music listener, and as such I make heavy use of playlists
to mix and match music I like and listen it for long periods of time. This is a
list of playlists I have created over time that may be interesting to someone
else out there.

Having them here also helps me not be a prisioner of any one music listening
service: as I have them all in JSON and M3U formats, I can easily migrate them
between different services if I so wish to.
