I'm a millenial technologist based in Belo Horizonte, Brazil who enjoys nerding
out on Science literature and Podcasts, playing video/board games and SCUBA dive
whenever I get the chance - something you got to give me credit for as I live in
a landlocked state. If diving isn't available, I'll take trekking in our beautiful
mountains and being around nature as much as possible, too!

My career has been defined by moving up-and-down the technology stack, working
a lot on the infrastructure bits of the Internet as a whole. I've witnessed
(and worked on) servers being consolidated into VMs, then moved to "The Cloud",
then being further consolidated into containers and shoved into clusters of
unpronunciable orchestrators. I built software for the finance sector and for fun,
too. Profit is nice but we humans need more than that, don't we?

I write most of my code in Python, but I'm interested in the workings of Go, Rust
and Functional languages too.

I don't have an exact focus or topic I plan to write about in this site. I'm not
SEO'ing myself into career advance, I just want to share some stuff without
having to be part on a specific social network.

And dogs are better than people, of course!
