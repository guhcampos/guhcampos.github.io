# guhcampos website builder

Hello! If you're reading this you're probably interested on the code I use to
generate my website, so you have probably been there.

I'm opensourcing this as a fun project to showcase, a purposedly overengineered
way to exercise some good practices in development and keep my brain working while
taking a break from work or Factorio (which are kind of the same thing?).

Please feel free to suggest (potentially useless?) stuff to add here for fun or
(even better so) profit. I'm also happy to contribute any (I doubt it) useful
code to other projects.

In the unlikely event that someone else besides future-me decides to use this,
the project is installable using `uv`, so all you need to do is:

```
uv sync
uv run guhcampos --help
```

Everything else should make sense (I doubt it will, even for future me.)
